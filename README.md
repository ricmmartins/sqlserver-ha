```

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Bash shell environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, or Azure Cloud Shell)
- An Azure subscription with contributor permissions
- Basic understanding of SQL Server and networking concepts

## Deployment Process

1. **Deploy SQL Server VMs**
The [deploy-sql-ha.sh](scripts/deploy-sql-ha.sh) fully automates the deployment of a production-ready, highly available SQL Server environment on Azure. Hereâ€™s what the script sets up:
   - Resource Group with detailed tags for ownership and cost management  
   - Virtual Network (VNet) and subnet for secure isolation  
   - Network Security Group (NSG) with rules for RDP, SQL, and AG endpoints  
   - Availability Set for VM fault domain and update domain separation  
   - Azure Key Vault for secure credential storage  
   - Two SQL Server VMs (Windows + SQL 2019 Standard), fully registered with the SQL IaaS Agent Extension  
   - NICs with accelerated networking enabled for performance  
   - Premium SSD Managed Disks for OS, data, logs, and tempdb (optimized for SQL workloads)  
   - Public IPs (static, standard SKU) for each VM  
   - Azure Backup Recovery Services Vault with daily backup policy for each VM  
   - Azure Monitor Action Group and CPU alert rules for both VMs  
   - Resource lock to prevent accidental deletion  
   - Deployment variable file for easy reuse of environment details  

2. **Configure SQL Server Availability Group**
   - After deploying the SQL VMs, set up the Availability Group with the [setup-availability-group.sh](scripts/setup-availability-group.sh) script.

3. **Validate Your Deployment**
   - After setting up the environment, validate it using the [validate-ha-deployment.sh](scripts/validate-ha-deployment.sh) script.

## Detailed Validation Guide

This guide helps you validate your SQL Server High Availability deployment in Azure. See [docs/validation-guide.md](docs/validation-guide.md) for detailed instructions.

## Key Validation Areas

1. **High Availability (Availability Set)**
   - Verify fault domain and update domain configuration
   - Confirm VM placement within the Availability Set

2. **SQL IaaS Agent Extension**
   - Check registration status and configuration
   - Verify auto-patching settings

3. **Availability Group Configuration**
   - Connect to SQL Server and validate AG status
   - Check replica synchronization
   - Test the listener connection

4. **Failover Testing**
   - Perform manual failover between replicas
   - Simulate node failures and observe automatic failover

## Azure SQL Server VM Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Security
- Store credentials in Azure Key Vault â€” never in code or output
- Use managed identities for authentication between services
- Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) with least-privilege access; scope rules only to required ports (SQL, RDP, AG)
- Enable Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for databases
- Use Azure Private Link for secure connectivity to services
- Resource lock to prevent accidental resource deletion
- Generate secure, random passwords for SQL admin accounts

### 2. Performance
- Use Premium SSDs for SQL Server data, log, and TempDB files
- Separate data, log, and TempDB files onto dedicated disks for best throughput
- Place TempDB on the local SSD (D:) drive for optimal performance
- Configure proper autogrowth settings for database files
- Size VMs appropriately with adequate memory for SQL Server's buffer pool
- Enable accelerated networking for low-latency traffic
- Optimize disk caching per workload:
  - *ReadOnly* for data disks
  - *None* for log disks
  - *ReadWrite* for TempDB

### 3. High Availability
- Deploy VMs in an Availability Set to spread across fault and update domains
- Register VMs with the SQL IaaS Agent Extension (use retry logic for reliability)
- Explicitly allow AG endpoint traffic (port 5022) in NSGs

### 4. Manageability & Monitoring
- Enable Azure Backup with a policy for daily VM backups
- Configure Azure Monitor for SQL insights and key metrics (CPU, memory, storage, AG health)
- Set up alerts for performance and availability events
- Use SQL Server Extended Events for advanced performance monitoring
- Implement automated backup verification
- Consistent resource tagging for tracking and automation
- Detailed logging for every deployment step

### 5. Deployment Reliability
- Idempotent, robust scripting (e.g., `set -e`, retry logic for transient Azure API failures)
- Wait for RBAC propagation before storing secrets in Key Vault
- Export critical deployment values for use in future automation or teardown

## Troubleshooting
For common issues and solutions, refer to [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

Common Issues

- Connection failures to the AG listener
- Synchronization issues between replicas
- Performance problems under load
- Failover failures or unexpected behavior

## ðŸš¦ Recommendations for Production Deployments

While this project demonstrates a reference high-availability SQL Server setup, **additional steps are required for production-grade environments**. For a production deployment, please consider:

- **Harden Security:**  
  - Remove public IPs from SQL VMs and rely on private endpoints and jump hosts/bastion for admin access.
  - Restrict NSG rules to only whatâ€™s absolutely necessary.  
  - Enable Azure Defender for SQL and use advanced threat protection.

- **Identity and Access:**  
  - Use managed identities for automation and minimize usage of admin credentials.
  - Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) VM access and Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for admin operations.

- **Backup and DR:**  
  - Define and test regular backup and restore strategies.
  - Consider Geo-Redundant backup vaults and geo-replication for business-critical data.
  - Regularly test failover and restore procedures.

- **High Availability and Resiliency:**  
  - Use Availability Zones instead of just Availability Sets where possible.
  - Deploy a domain controller if required for Windows Clustering.
  - Set up a listener with an Internal Load Balancer for Always On Availability Groups.

- **Monitoring and Alerts:**  
  - Integrate with Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and set up actionable alerts on health, backups, and performance.
  - Enable SQL Server auditing and diagnostic settings.

- **Cost and Performance:**  
  - Size VMs/disks based on workload; consider Reserved Instances for cost savings.
  - Use Premium SSDs or Ultra Disks as needed for storage performance.

- **Automation and Governance:**  
  - Deploy using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), with parameterization for environments.
  - Apply resource locks, tags, and use policy for governance and compliance.
